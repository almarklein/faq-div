    <h2>General</h2>

    <h3>What is the purpose of TimeTurtle?</h3>

    <p>TimeTurtle allows you to track your time, to maintain an overview of
    the tasks that you spend your time on, either because you need to
    declare these hours (e.g. to bill hours as a freelancer),
    or simply because you want more insight in what you spend your time on.</p>

    <h3>How does TimeTurtle work?</h3>

    <p>The main method of tracking time is by starting and stopping a timer
    by clicking a button. Records can also be added and edited later.
    TimeTurtle offers a unique interactive experience, based around a linear
    timeline. It's easy to navigate the timeline using buttons, scrolling and swiping.
    All the time, the overview panel shows useful statistics. E.g. by
    zooming out to a week, month, or year, you're just seconds away from
    getting a clear overview.</p>
    <h2>Running TimeTurtle on ...</h2>
    <h3>What browsers are supported?</h3>

    <p>Supported browsers include Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge, and their mobile counterparts.</p>

    <h3>Does TimeTurtle work on mobile devices?</h3>

    <p>Yes, the TimeTurtle app is designed to work well on small screens.
    Simply open it in your mobile webbrowser. If it does not work with your
    standard browser, we recommend installing Firefox or Chrome.</p>
    <p>TimeTurtle can also be installed as a native app on Android and iOS:
    open the app (https://timeturtle.app<b>/app</b>) in your phone's browser, and
    select "Add to homescreen". Some devices will show a prompt, in others you may
    find the option in the menu.</p>
    <h3>Is TimeTurtle available via Google Play / the Appstore?</h3>

    <p>TimeTurtle is designed as a Progressive Web
    App (PWA), which makes it possible to install it outside of the playstore/appstore, see above.
    We may at some point add it to the official stores to make it
    easier for users to discover and install TimeTurtle.</p>
    <h3>Can TimeTurtle be run as a desktop app?</h3>

    <p>Yes. Open the app in the Chrome browser, and then select "Install
    TimeTurtle App" (or similar).</p>
    <h3>Can TimeTurtle be used off-line?</h3>

    <p>Yes, in any way you are using TimeTurtle (from a browser, mobile app, or desktop app),
    the TimeTurtle app page will still work when there is no internet connection.</p>
    <p>New records (and changes to existing records) are stored in
    the browser/application cache. Therefore, when you don't have an internet
    connection (e.g. while traveling), you can safely use TimeTurtle and let it sync
    later. You can safely close the browser, but note that the local data is cleared
    when you log out.</p>



    <h2>Plans and billing</h2>

    <h3>Can I try TimeTurtle for free?</h3>

    <p>Yes, you can <a href='/signup'>sign up</a> to get access to the Starter
    plan, which is free forever. The Pro plan can be tried for free for 10 days.</p>
    <h3>How can I purchase the Pro plan?</h3>
    <p>You must first sign up for an account. By default you are on the Starter plan.
    You can then purchase the Pro plan via the <a href="/account">account page</a>.
    We make use of <a href="https://paddle.com">Paddle</a> to handle our purchases
    with a simple and secure checkout experience.</p>
    <h3>Do the prices include VAT?</h3>
    <p>Yes, all our prices include VAT. The amount of VAT depends on your
    country and whether you represent a company. The VAT is calculated
    automatically and will be shown on your invoice.</p>
    <h3>Can I purchase the Pro plan if I don't have a creditcard?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can pay with creditcard or Paypal. If you prefer to pay from
    your bank account, you can create a Paypal account (if you don't already
    have one) and link it up with your bank account.</p>
    <h3>Can I purchase a subscription from my business?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can! During the checkout, you can enter your VAT number and
    company details. You can also edit these details on the invoice that
    you receive via email.</p>
    <h3>Can I be billed monthly?</h3>
    <p>At the moment we only bill annually. With prices as low as ours, the
    overhead costs per transaction (if we'd bill monthly) would make up
    about half the total price.</p>
    <h3>How can I cancel my Pro plan?</h3>
    <p>You can cancel your plan from the account page. This will bring you
    back to the Starter plan. You keep all the projects that you currently have,
    but will be unable to create new projects if you already have more than
    the maximum of the Starter plan.</p>



    <h2>Bugs and features</h2>

    <h3>What features can I expect in the (near) future?</h3>

    <p>We keep a public <a href="https://gitlab.com/canpute/timeapp/boards">issue board</a>, where
    you can see the things that are on the roadmap. You can also let us know your
    interests by voting on the issues corresponding to certain features.</p>
    <h3>How can I request a feature?</h3>

    <p>First check our <a href="https://gitlab.com/canpute/timeapp/issues">issue list</a> whether
    the issue has been requested already. If so, hit the thumbs-up sign to let us
    know your interest (you need to be logged in with Gitlab for this).
    Otherwise, create a new issue (if you have an account with Gitlab) or <a href="/support">contact us</a>.</p>
    <h3>I think I discovered a bug, what should I do?</h3>

    <p>First check the <a href="https://gitlab.com/canpute/timeapp/issues">issue list</a> whether
    the bug is already known. If not, please create a new issue or <a href="/support">contact us</a>.</p>



    <h2>The application</h2>

    <h3>How do I create groups and sub-projects?</h3>

    <p>In TimeTurtle, each project can be seen as a label. Projects are grouped
    <em>implicitly</em> based on their name, using the forward slash (<code>"/"</code>). E.g. to
    make a project <code>"admin"</code> a subproject of <code>"unpaid work"</code>, simply rename it
    <code>"unpaid work/admin"</code>. The project <code>"unpaid work"</code> does not even have
    to exist by itself.</p>
    <h3>Can I merge two projects?</h3>

    <p>Yes, a project can be merged with another simply by giving it the same
    name. The dialog will display a warning that a merge will take place.
    In practice, a merge means that all time records associated with one
    of the projects are updated to use the other, and the now unused project
    is hidden. Try it out in de <a href='/demo'>demo</a>!</p>



    <h2>Importing and exporting</h2>

    <h3>How can I import data?</h3>

    <p>TimeTurtle can import time records from Excel or CSV files, e.g.
    to restore from your own backup, or to import time records from another
    tracker.</p>
    <p>In the app, click the menu button and select "import records". It is recommended
    to first import your data in the <a target="new" href="/sandbox">sandbox</a>
    so you can check that the import has the expected result.</p>
    <p>Importing should just work for time records exported by Yast, and
    possibly other trackers too. If you have trouble getting the import to
    work, open your data in a spreadsheet (e.g. Excel, Libre Office, Google
    sheets) and see if it might need a change in the header names, or
    perhaps a small conversion.</p>
    <p>Below you'll find the technical details on what TimeTurtle expects for imported data.
    Feel free to <a href="/support">send</a> an (anonymised) sample, so
    we can add support for your data or help you convert it.</p>

    <h3>How should my import-data be formatted?</h3>

    <p>The import data should consist of rows, where each row represents one
    record, and the top row is the header. Values on a row can be separated
    with either tab, comma, or semicolon (this is automatically detected).
    Wrapping values in double-quotes (as is common in CSV files) is
    supported.</p>
    <p>The supported headers are listed below. Common aliases for each field
    are automatically converted. Each record should be resolvable into
    at least a project, a start time and a stop time.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>key:</b> existing records are replaced if they match the given key/id. If no key is provided, existing
    records are replaced if the start/stop times match.</li>
    <li><b>project:</b> the name of the project associated with the record.</li>
    <li><b>start time:</b> a Unix timestamp or other date-time string (e.g. ISO 8601).</li>
    <li><b>stop time:</b> a Unix timestamp or other date-time string (e.g. ISO 8601).</li>
    <li><b>description:</b> the description/comment. Newlines and tabs are removed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additional headers are supported to deal with exports of other trackers:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>date:</b> if given, the start time can also be in <code>hh:mm</code> or <code>hh:mm:ss</code> format.</li>
    <li><b>duration:</b> can be <code>hh:mm</code>, <code>hh:mm:ss</code>, or simply the number of seconds. Is used when the stop time is not of the preferred format.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How can I export my data?</h3>

    <p>TimeTurtle has two export mechanisms: the report and the full export.</p>
    <p>The report dialog (which opens via the report button on the
    left) produces a table that can be saved as PDF or copied into a spreadsheet.
    The latter can be convenient if you want to process data of a
    certain project and/or time period. It can also represent durations
    in decimal hours, which is usually easier to process in a spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>The full export dialog (which opens via the menu) produces a table that
    contains the data of all your records. The table can be copied into a
    text file or a spreadsheet, and has the following columns: key, project,
    start, stop, description. The output of a full export gives you access
    to your "raw" data, and can e.g. be used in the import dialog.</p>
